# Easy-Gig project outline

Current goals: 
 - Profile/Links: consolidate profile link/signout link into one dropdown menu, add more links/diversify from there (consider placing create account there)
 - Profile Box: update profile, user cannot view password in profile, only username and email, maintain edit button for those two
    - add another button for changing password
    - never store password
 - Style changes throughout the website (mainly buttons)

Bug Fixes:
 - display posts button do further testing, when user deletes the final post add a function to check if there are any posts remaining, if the user has no posts remaining, automatically change the display posts button back to show posts.
 - when trying to sign in two times, error sign displays stack (should replace each other)
